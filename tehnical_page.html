            <p>Performance management (PM) is the process of ensuring that a set of activities and outputs meets an
                organization's goals in an effective and efficient manner. Performance management can focus on the
                performance of an organization, a department, an employee, or the processes in place to manage
                particular tasks. Performance management standards are generally organized and disseminated by senior
                leadership at an organization and by task owners, it can include specifying tasks and outcomes of a job,
                providing timely feedback and coaching, comparing employee's actual performance and behaviors with
                desired performance and behaviors, instituting rewards, etc. It is necessary to outline the role of each
                individual in the organization in terms of functions and responsibilities to ensure that performance
                management is successful.</p>

            <p>Performance management principles are used most often in the workplace and can be applied wherever people
                interact with their environments to produce desired effectsâ€”schools, churches, community meetings,
                sports teams, health settings, governmental agencies, social events, and even political settings.
                The way performance management is applied is important in getting the most out of the group. It can have
                a positive impact on how employees perform on a day-to-day basis. In order to avoid a negative impact,
                it must be applied in a way that does not encourage internal competition, but rather teamwork,
                cooperation, and trust. This is done through an implementation process of clarifying the work that has
                to be done, setting goals and establishing a performance plan, frequently providing coaching, conducting
                a formal review, and recognizing and rewarding top performance. Managers use performance management to
                align company goals with the goals of teams and employees in an effort to increase efficiency,
                productivity, and profitability. Performance management guidelines stipulate clearly the activities and
                outcomes by which employees and teams are evaluated during performance appraisal.

            <p>This process is continual, with regular sessions where both management and employees have the opportunity
                to give and receive feedback. According to the Gallup State of the American Workplace study, only 22% of
                employees are engaged and thriving. Employees who are engaged and thriving are more likely to maintain
                strong work performance, even during difficult times. This also means that 78% of the workforce could do
                better work if only their organization had the right type of management process. Some reasons cited in
                this study for lack of motivation are seeing less deserving employees receive promotions, lack of
                actionable feedback, and management not involving employees in goal setting. All of these taken together
                show the importance of the performance management process, and why each part of it must be done well for
                the process as a whole to succeed.</p>

            <p>Agencies develop performance management systems subject to OPM regulations and approval.</p>
            <p>Agency systems must contain 5 summary performance levels as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Outstanding</li>
                <li>Exceeds Fully</li>

                <li>Unsatisfactory</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The supervisor establishes performance elements and requirements in consultation with the executive and
                consistent with the goals and performance expectations in the agency's strategic planning initiatives.
                The supervisor proposes the initial summary rating, based on both individual and organizational
                performance, and taking into account customer satisfaction and employee perspective.</p>
            <p>The executive's initial summary rating is reviewed by a Performance Review Board (PRB). The agency head
                determines the executive's annual summary rating.</p>

            <p>For employee performance management, using integrated software, rather than a spreadsheet-based recording
                system, may deliver a return on investment through a range of direct and indirect sales benefits,
                operational efficiency benefits, and by unlocking the latent potential in every employee workday (i.e.,
                the time they spend not actually doing their job). Benefits may include:

            <p>Performance management is the term used to refer to activities, tools, processes, and programs that
                companies create or apply to manage the performance of individual employees, teams, departments, and
                other organizational units within their organizational influence. In contrast, performance appraisal
                refers to the act of appraising or evaluating performance during a given performance period to determine
                how well an employee, a vendor or an organizational unit has performed relative to agreed objectives or
                goals, and this is only one of many important activities within the overall concept of performance
                management. Many people equate performance management with performance appraisal. This is a common
                misconception.</p>
            <p>Organizations and companies typically manage employee performance over a formal 12-month period
                (otherwise known as the formal company performance period).</p>
            <p>The results of performance management exercises are used in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Employee development planning to select the most appropriate and suitable development intervention
                    to improve employees' knowledge, skills and behavior
                </li>
                <li>Factual basis for compensation and rewards (pay raise & bonuses being the most common)</li>
                <li>Factual basis in consideration with other factors for mobility (Example: transfers and promotions)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each year companies spend millions on their performance management systems. In order for performance
                management to be successful, businesses must continue to adapt their system to correct their current
                deficiencies. Some aspects may resonate more with employees compared to others (e.g., goal setting or
                performance bonuses).Effective management will set up a performance management system that is
                distinctive and consistent. The goal is to continue to alter the system to have higher employee
                engagement and increase their employeesâ€™ performance at work. In turn, companies hope this results in
                less turnover and creates a better workplace environment.</p>

            <p>Business performance management (also known as "corporate performance management" (CPM) and "enterprise
                performance management" is a set of performance management and analytic processes that enables the
                management of an organization's performance to achieve one or more pre-selected goals. Gartner retired
                the concept of "CPM" and reclassified it as "financial planning and analysis (FP&A)," and "financial
                close" to reflect two concepts: increased focus on planning and the emergence of a new category of
                solutions supporting the management of the financial close.</p>
            <p>Business performance management has three main activities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Selection of goals</li>
                <li>Consolidation of data that is relevant to an organization's progress</li>

            <p>Performance measurement is the process of collecting, analyzing and/or reporting information regarding
                the performance of an individual, group, organization, system or component. Definitions of performance
                measurement tend to be predicated upon an assumption about why the performance is being measured.
            <ul>
                <li>Moulin defines the term with a forward-looking organisational focusâ€”"the process of evaluating how
                    well organisations are managed and the value they deliver for customers and other stakeholders".
                </li>
                <li>Neely et al. use a more operational retrospective focusâ€”"the process of quantifying the efficiency

                </li>
                <li>In 2007 the Office of the Chief Information Officer in the USA defined it using a more evaluative

        <header>Why is performance management important?</header>
        <article>
            <p>In any organization, no matter the size, it is important to understand what your employees are doing, how
                they are doing it, and why they are doing it. Without a system in place to define roles, understand
                individual strengths and weaknesses, provide constructive feedback, trigger interventions and reward
                positive behavior, it is much more difficult for managers to effectively lead their employees. Smart
                organizations pair their performance management with an incentive management process. The two systems
                have a lot in common, from defining roles and setting goals to reviewing and rewarding employee
                behavior, and as such, do very well when run simultaneously. Using incentive management also means that
                the all-important â€˜rewardâ€™ step of performance management is done properly.</p>

            <p><strong>PDCA (planâ€“doâ€“checkâ€“act or planâ€“doâ€“checkâ€“adjust)</strong>is an iterative design and management
                method used in business for the control and continuous improvement of processes and products.It is also
                known as the Deming circle/cycle/wheel, the Shewhart cycle, the control circle/cycle, or
                planâ€“doâ€“studyâ€“act (PDSA).</p>
            <p>Another version of this PDCA cycle is OPDCA. The added "O" stands for observation or as some versions
                say: "Observe the current condition." This emphasis on observation and current condition has currency
                with the literature on lean manufacturing and the Toyota Production System. The PDCA cycle, with
                Ishikawaâ€™s changes, can be traced back to S. Mizuno of the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1959</p>
